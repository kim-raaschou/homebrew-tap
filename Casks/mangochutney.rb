  caveats <<~EOS
    Start it, and allow Accessibility in the window it shows:
      open -a "Mango Chutney"
    To start it at login (and again after an upgrade):
      mmsg service install
    Stop AeroSpace, yabai or any other tiling window manager first.

    Remember two keys: Hyper K lists every key, Hyper L picks a layout.
    Hyper is the key you choose on the first start, as Raycast's Hyper Key (Caps Lock, …).
